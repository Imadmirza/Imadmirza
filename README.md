# 👋 Hi, I'm Mirza Imaduddin!  

I’m an **Electronics and Communication Engineer** turned **Data Enthusiast**, passionate about building efficient data pipelines, designing automated workflows, and creating impactful solutions through code.  

I love turning problems into structured processes — whether it’s automating a task, optimizing a workflow, or uncovering insights hidden in data.  
My journey also includes developing physics content for students, where I learned the art of breaking down complex ideas into simple, logical steps — a skill I now apply to data and automation.
